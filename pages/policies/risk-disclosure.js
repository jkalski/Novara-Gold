          <p>The purchase and sale of physical precious metals, including but not limited to gold, silver, platinum, and palladium (collectively "Precious Metals"), involves a high degree of risk. By engaging in transactions with Novara Gold ("the Company"), you ("the Client") acknowledge, represent, and agree to the following:</p>
          
          <h3>1. Market Risk</h3>
          <p>Precious Metals are subject to substantial price fluctuations, which may be influenced by, without limitation, international monetary and political events, central bank policies, interest rate changes, currency valuations, supply and demand conditions, speculative activities, and other macroeconomic factors. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The Client understands that the value of Precious Metals may decrease, and that the Client may sustain a partial or total loss of principal.</p>
          
          <h3>2. Liquidity Risk</h3>
          <p>While Precious Metals generally have established secondary markets, there can be no assurance of liquidity at any given time. The Company does not guarantee that it will repurchase any Precious Metals previously sold. Any repurchase by the Company shall be conducted at its sole discretion and subject to prevailing market conditions. The Client acknowledges that the Company's buy-back policy is voluntary, non-binding, and not an enforceable obligation.</p>
          
          <h3>3. Custody, Storage, and Delivery Risk</h3>
          <p>The Company may, at the Client's direction, arrange for storage of Precious Metals with independent third-party depositories. Such depositories are not affiliated with the Company, and while they may provide insurance and security measures, the Company does not warrant or guarantee the performance, solvency, or obligations of such custodians. All shipments and deliveries are subject to carrier terms, insurance limits, and claims processes. Risk of loss shall transfer to the Client upon confirmed delivery, or, in the case of storage, upon receipt by the designated depository.</p>
          
          <h3>4. Regulatory and Tax Considerations</h3>
          <p>The purchase and sale of Precious Metals may carry tax, reporting, or regulatory consequences under federal, state, or foreign law. The Company does not provide legal, accounting, or tax advice. The Client is solely responsible for consulting with qualified advisors regarding any such consequences. The Client further acknowledges that Precious Metals are not securities, are not FDIC or SIPC insured, and are not subject to the protections of any government deposit insurance program.</p>
          
          <h3>5. Product Risk</h3>
          <p>Certain products, including proof coins, numismatic or semi-numismatic coins, and limited-edition items, may carry premiums materially higher than the intrinsic metal value. Such premiums may not be recoverable upon resale. The Client assumes all risks associated with purchasing products that are not primarily priced on bullion content.</p>
          
          <h3>6. No Guarantee of Profit or Protection</h3>
          <p>The Company makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees, express or implied, regarding the future value, appreciation, or marketability of any Precious Metals. Precious Metals are considered long-term holdings and may not be suitable for all investors. The Client should only invest discretionary funds that they can afford to lose.</p>
          
          <h3>7. Acknowledgment</h3>
          <p>By transacting with the Company, the Client acknowledges and affirms that they have read, understood, and accept the foregoing disclosures, and that they are aware of and willing to assume the risks associated with the purchase, ownership, storage, and sale of Precious Metals.</p>
